<h1> Story </h1>  
<p align="justify">After the death of her father, she was adopted by House Vance and became Harley's sister. Lesley regarded her younger brother as everything to her, and kept protecting Harley secretly.

<h1>Abilities</h1>
<p align="justify">LETHAL SHOT If Lesley doesn't take damage for 5 seconds, her next Basic Attack gains extra range and 50% Critical Chance and deals 50 (+100% Total Physical Attack) True Damage (20% extra damage against minions).
Each point of fixed Physical Penetration Lesley acquires is converted into 0.5% Critical Damage, but her base Critical Damage is reduced to 140%.
Lesley's Basic Attack restores 5 points of energy and her Lethal Shot doubles the amount of energy restored. The cooldown of Lethal Shot resets each time Lesley casts a skill.
Skill terms
Crit Rate
Chance to cause Crit Damage with Basic ATK (including Physical and Magic). The default is 0. A Crit Damage is guaranteed when it is over 100%. Some skills trigger this effect. For example: Layla's Malefic Bomb and the Typhoon effect of Windtalker.
Physical PEN
Deduct enemy’s Physical Defense by a fixed point or by percent. Enemy’s actual Physical Defense = Enemy’s Physical Defense × (100% - Percent of Physical PEN) - - Fixed points of Physical PEN.
Physical Basic Attack
Deal Physical Damage to enemies. Triggers ATK Effects and Lifesteal.

<p align="justify">	
MASTER OF CAMOUFLAGE Lesley enters the Camouflage state, gaining double Energy Regen, 40% extra Movement Speed, and 85–135 extra Physical Attack.
The state lasts 3 seconds or until Lesley takes or deals damage. Enemies can detect Lesley's position through distortions of their surroundings.
Skill terms
Camouflage
Enter Stealth State within the duration, won't be easily spotted by the enemy, can't be targeted by skills.
Physical ATK
Total current Physical ATK.
Movement Speed
Movement Speed on the battlefield. Usually Calculated and Actual Movement Speed is equal. But when Movement Speed is below 230 or over 420 both Slowdown and Speedup Effect will decay. Calculated Movement Speed = Basic Movement Speed × (100% + All Speedup Effect% - All Slowdown Effect%).

<p align="justify">TACTICAL GRENADE Lesley throws a tactical grenade in the target direction while slightly jumping back, dealing 150–300 to enemies in a cone and knocking them back.
Lesley can cast this skill during the Ultimate Snipe to cancel the state and immediately fire a Fatal Bullet at the target. The attack is only triggered when there are unfired Fatal Bullets left.

<p align="justify">ULTIMATE SNIPE LESLEY [gains vision to nearby enemies and can lock] onto the target enemy hero and fires 4 Lethal Bullets in succession, each dealing 250–350 (+80% Extra Physical Attack) (+enemy's 5% Lost HP) Physical Damage and restoring 10 energy on hit. The Bullets can be blocked by other enemy heroes.
If this skill is interrupted, each remaining Bullet reduces the skill cooldown by 10%.
Passive: Lesley's Crit Chance is increased by 5%–15%.



<h2> Lore </h2>
<p align="justify">Lesley grew up in the Vance household, where her father presided over the noble family's security. During an unexpected attack by a rival family, Lesley's father was killed. As the assailants approached the Vance household, Lesley took up her father's black long rifle and fulfilled her late father's mission. Tears rolled down Lesley's cheeks as she fired shot after shot, surprisingly, each one taking down an assassin. The final tear came as the final shot took down the last of the rival family's men.
Lesley was adopted by the Vance family, with the patriarch of the noble house even putting their sole heir, Harley under her tutelage. Harley, was a natural troublemaker, who used his talents in magic to unintentionally cause trouble for the Vance household. Only Lesley could keep Harley under control. Harley's troublemaking streak was the last part of warmth within Lesley's conscience.
After hearing about how Harley had travelled to the dangerous Land of Dawn after defeating the Boss of Dark Magic, Lesley followed him, along with her trusty heirloom rifle. After she found Harley through a long arduous journey, she discovered that the once immature young boy [has] changed through the numerous life experiences he had gone through. She decided it would be best to have her adopted little brother train, alone, while she would silently protect him from within the shadows. From that day on, all the monsters that were inflicted with Harley's magic would also be struck with a black bullet, that would impeccably pierce through their heart. The stories of the magical youngster who was followed by a mysterious black sniper, soon spread across the Land of Dawn, like wild fire.
